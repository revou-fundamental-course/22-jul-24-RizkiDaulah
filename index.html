            <h3>-1- Shibuya Crossing , Tokyo</h3>
            <p style="font-style: italic;">Shibuya Crossing, is a popular pedestrian scramble crossing in Shibuya, Tokyo, Japan. It is located in front of the Shibuya Station Hachik≈ç exit and stops vehicles in all directions to allow pedestrians to inundate the entire intersection. The statue of Hachik≈ç, between the station and the intersection, is a common meeting place, which is almost always crowded.

                Three large video screens mounted on nearby buildings overlook the crossing such as the landmark QFRONT, as well as many static advertising signs. Given its heavy traffic and amount of advertising, it is compared to Times Square in New York City.
                
                Shibuya Crossing is the world‚Äôs busiest pedestrian crossing, with as many as 3,000 people crossing at a time. Tokyo-based architecture professor Shane Flynn has said Shibuya Crossing is "a great example of what Tokyo does best when it's not trying</p>
            <h3>-2- Kinkakuji Temple , Kyoto</h3>
            <p>Kinkakuji Temple,  It is one of the most popular buildings in Kyoto, attracting many visitors annually. It is designated as a National Special Historic Site, a National Special Landscape and is one of 17 locations making up the Historic Monuments of Ancient Kyoto which are World Heritage Sites.</p>
            <h3>-3- Itsukushima Shrine , Hiroshima </h3>
            <p> Itsukushima shrine is one of Japan's most popular tourist attractions. It is most famous for its dramatic gate, or torii on the outskirts of the shrine, the sacred peaks of Mount Misen, extensive forests, and its ocean view. The shrine complex itself consists of two main buildings: the Honsha shrine and the Sessha Marodo-jinja, as well as 17 other different buildings and structures that help to distinguish it.</p>
            <h3>-4- Himeji Castle, Hyogo Prefecture </h3>
            <p> Himeji Castle is regarded as the finest surviving example of prototypical Japanese castle architecture, comprising a network of 83 rooms with advanced defensive systems from the feudal period. The castle is frequently known as Hakuro-j≈ç or Shirasagi-j≈ç ("White Egret Castle" or "White Heron Castle") because of its brilliant white exterior and supposed resemblance to a bird taking flight.
                As with almost all Japanese castles from the Azuchi-Momoyama period onward, the tenshu (Â§©ÂÆà, main keep), the most prominent structure, was used as a storehouse in times of peace and as a fortified tower in times of war, and the daimyo (Â§ßÂêç, feudal lord)'s government offices and residences were located in a group of single-story buildings near the tenshu and the surrounding yagura (Ê´ì, turrets).</p>
            <h3>-5- Nara-Juku, Nagano </h3>
            <p> Nara-Juku was the thirty-fourth of the sixty-nine stations of the Nakasend≈ç, as well as the second of eleven stations along the Kisoji.[1] It is located in the present-day city of Shiojiri, Nagano Prefecture, Japan.                
                Keisai Eisen's print of Narai-juku, part of the series The Sixty-nine Stations of the Kiso Kaid≈ç
                Narai-juku had the highest elevation of all the spots along the Kisoji. Because of all the visitors going through the Torii Pass (È≥•Â±ÖÂ≥† Torii T≈çge), Narai flourished as a post town and was referred to as the "Narai of 1,000 buildings" (Â•àËâØ‰∫ïÂçÉËªí Narai senken). It has since become one of Japan's Nationally Designated Architectural Preservation Sites, so the buildings have been kept much like they originally were in the Edo period.</p>
            <h3>-6- Motonosumi Shrine , Yamaguchi</h3>
            <p>Motonosumi shrine was established in 1955, reportedly at the behest of a white fox spirit, Motonosumi-jinja Shrine and its many red torii gates have become one of the most well-known locations in Yamaguchi. A spiritual center that's a lot of fun to visit, Motonosumi-jinja Shrine is a must-see attraction</p>
